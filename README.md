What is Neurika AI Assistant?

Working with databases is powerful, but it's often complex and requires learning a query language like SQL. Neurika AI Assistant changes that.

Neurika is an intelligent tool that connects to your database and acts as your personal data analyst. It allows anyone, regardless of technical skill, to get insights from their data simply by asking questions in plain English.

    Instead of writing: SELECT COUNT(id) FROM users WHERE created_at >= '2025-11-01' AND team_id = 5;

    You can just ask: "How many new users joined team 5 this month?"

This repository contains the complete full-stack application code.
